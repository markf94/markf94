I'm a theoretical physicist by training and entrepreneur & pythonista by choice. I co-founded the Toronto-based biotech startup [ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com) where we built one of the world's first computational platforms for protein therapeutics (think 3D CAD for molecules) and the [Quantum Open Source Foundation](https://qosf.org). Nowadays, I spent most of my time building a molecular database with [mongoengine](https://github.com/MongoEngine/mongoengine), petascale drug discovery workflows using [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows), multi-property optimization algorithms using [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) as well as quantum-classical hybrid networks with [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) and [TensorFlow Quantum](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum).
