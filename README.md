I'm a theoretical physicist by training and entrepreneur & pythonista by choice. I co-founded the Toronto-based biotech startup [ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com) where we built one of the world's first computational platforms for protein therapeutics (think 3D CAD for molecules) and the [Quantum Open Source Foundation](https://qosf.org). Nowadays, I spent most of my time managing the ML team at ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com) whilst also doing all of the interior design for our new company office. On the technical side, I'm working on multi-property optimization algorithms using [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) and Bayesian optimization, designing proteins & peptides with generative AI such as [RFDiffusion]() and [ColabDesign]() as well as spending a lot of time building proprietary ML models for peptide drug delivery & discovery together with my team at ProteinQure. My MSc was about "Learning Curves of Quantum Kernel Machines" which made extensive use of quantum-classical hybrid networks built with [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) and [TensorFlow Quantum](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum)
