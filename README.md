I'm a scientific ML leader and entrepreneur with a background in theoretical physics. I co-founded the Toronto-based biotech [ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com), where I lead the scientific ML team and help build a ML-driven platform for protein and peptide therapeutics (think 3D CAD for molecules). I also co-founded the [Quantum Open Source Foundation](https://qosf.org) (QOSF).

My work focuses on generative models for proteins and peptides, molecular property prediction, multi-property optimization, and scalable production ML systems for drug discovery. At ProteinQure, I work closely with a multidisciplinary team on proprietary ML models for peptide drug delivery and discovery, spanning model development, optimization, experimental validation and real-world experimental integration.

Technically, I spend time on evolutionary algorithms (using [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)), Bayesian optimization, diffusion-based generative models (e.g. [RFDiffusion](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion), [BindCraft](https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft)), and custom ML tooling for scientific workflows. My MSc research explored learning curves of quantum kernel machines, using quantum–classical hybrid models built with built with [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) and [TensorFlow Quantum](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum).
