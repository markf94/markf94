### Welcome, human 👋

I'm a theoretical physicist by training and entrepreneur & Pythonista by choice. I co-founded the Toronto-based biotech startup [ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com) where we built one of the world's first computational platforms for protein therapeutics (think 3D CAD for molecules). Nowadays, I spent most of my time building
